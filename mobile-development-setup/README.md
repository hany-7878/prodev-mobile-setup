# 📱 Mobile Development with React Native, TypeScript & Expo

##  Introduction

This repository documents my learning journey in **mobile application development** using **React Native**, **TypeScript**, **NativeWindCSS**, and the **Expo Framework**.

As a student, my goal is to understand how modern cross-platform mobile apps are built, structured, styled, and tested using industry-standard tools. Each project folder represents a **hands-on milestone** completed through guided tasks and practice.


## 🚀 Technologies Used

* **React Native** – Build native mobile apps using JavaScript & React
* **TypeScript** – Strong typing for safer and more maintainable code
* **Expo Framework** – Simplified setup, testing, and deployment
* **NativeWindCSS** – Utility-first styling for React Native
* **Expo Router** – File-based navigation


## 🎯 Learning Objectives

Through this project, I aimed to:

* Set up a complete mobile development environment
* Build and test apps on real devices using Expo Go
* Understand React Native core components
* Apply proper styling and layout techniques
* Implement safe areas, images, buttons, and forms
* Follow clean project structure and best practices

## 🧩 Task 0: Mobile Development Environment Setup

### Objective

Prepare a smooth mobile development environment using Expo and a physical device.

### Tools Installed

* Node.js (LTS)
* VS Code
* Expo CLI
* Expo Go (Android / iOS)

### Key Takeaways

* Expo Go allows real-device testing without emulators
* QR-based testing is fast and efficient
* Environment setup is crucial for mobile performance

📁 **Directory:** `mobile-development-setup`
📄 **File:** `README.md`


## 🧩 Task 1: Create Your First Mobile App

### Objective

Learn Expo project scaffolding and file structure.

### What I Did

* Created an Expo app using the Expo Router template
* Modified the home screen text
* Tested the app using Expo Go
* Reset the project to observe template cleanup

### Observation

Running `npm run reset-project` removes sample files and resets the app to a clean starting point.

## 🧩 Task 2: React Native Components & Styling

### Objective

Understand how React Native components replace HTML elements.

### Concepts Learned

* `<View>` instead of `<div>`
* `<Text>` instead of `<p>`
* Styling using `StyleSheet.create()`

### Outcome

* Created multiple text components
* Applied reusable styles
* Improved layout organization

📁 **Directory:** `prodev-mobile-app-0x01`


## 🧩 Task 3: Safe Areas, Images & Touchable Components

### Objective

Build a responsive landing screen with real-world UI elements.

### Features Implemented

* SafeAreaView for notch-safe layouts
* Full-screen background image
* Company logo display
* Action buttons using TouchableOpacity
* Responsive design using Dimensions

📁 **Directory:** `prodev-mobile-app-0x02`


## 🧩 Task 4: Exploring More Core Components

### Objective

Build a functional login screen using multiple React Native components.

### What I Built

* Email & password inputs
* Password visibility icon
* Social login buttons
* Custom reusable styles
* Stack navigation using Expo Router

### Skills Gained

* Better component organization
* Improved styling consistency
* Strong understanding of form layouts

📁 **Directory:** `prodev-mobile-app-0x03`


## ▶️ How to Run the Project

```bash
npm install
npx expo start
```

Scan the QR code using the **Expo Go** app on your phone.


## 📌 Key Learning Outcomes

* Cross-platform mobile development fundamentals
* Real-device testing using Expo Go
* Clean UI design with reusable styles
* Safe layout handling for different devices
* Confidence working with React Native projects

## 🙌 Final Note

This repository reflects my **learning progress as a student**, focusing on practice, understanding, and clean implementation rather than shortcuts. Each task helped strengthen my confidence in mobile development and prepared me for more advanced projects.

✨ Thank you for reviewing my work!
